    "description": "Airsoft guns are replica toy guns used in airsoft sports. They are a special type of low-power smoothbore air guns designed to shoot non-metallic spherical projectiles (pb) often colloquially (but incorrectly) referred to as \"BBs\", which are typically made of (but not limited to) plastic or biodegradable resin materials. Airsoft gun powerplants are designed to have low muzzle energy ratings (generally less than 1.5 J, or 1.1 ft⋅lb) and the pellets have significantly less penetrative and stopping powers than conventional airguns, and are generally safe for competitive sporting and recreational purposes if proper protective gear is worn.",

    "description": "Airsoft pellets are spherical projectiles used by airsoft guns. Typically made of plastic, they usually measure around 6 mm (0.24 in) in diameter (though selective models use 8 mm), and weigh 0.12–0.40 g (1.9–6.2 gr), with the most common weights being 0.12 g and 0.20 g, while 0.25 g, 0.28 g, 0.30 g and 0.40 g pellets are also commonplace. Though frequently referred to as \"BBs\" among airsoft users, these pellets are not the same as either of the 4.5 mm metal projectiles that BB guns fire, or the 4.6 mm (0.180 in)-sized birdshot from which the term \"BB\" originated.",

The barrel is also handsomely nickel plated. Good for 290fps when using HFC22 TOP Gas! Gun is heavy thanks to the heavy metal frame.

As a result, Specna Arms® EDGE™ BBs are ideal for standard barrels, while they reach their full potential in precision barrels.\r\n\r\nAt the final stage of production, high-polish is carefully applied to every BB made by Specna Arms®. Afterwards, EDGE™ BBs are laced with a special friction-reducing layer in order to ensure a problem-free cooperation with precision barrels.  This also results in a better cooperation with Hop-Up buckings.\r\n\r\nThanks to a full control over the production process, the manufacturer achieves ideally-spherical BBs without visible cavities or seams. A well-distributed center of gravity combined with a lack of air space inside the BB allow for a very good repeatability of shots.",
